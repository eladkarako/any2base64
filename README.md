Note that SVG files with Unicode/UTF-8 characters will be broken, this seems to be a bug in every browser implementation, so you probably won't be able to include such SVG file in an inline-image SRC or CSS as is, instead you would be required to use JavaScript and decode the base64 into binary string, following with converting it back to non-binary string using `decodeURIComponent(escape(str))`. This happend due to the rendering of characters in the SVG engine and not related to `charset` argument. Currently this issue happens in all browsers. Better use PNG/GIF (alternativly you may use HTML-ENTITY encoded HTML source instead...)
